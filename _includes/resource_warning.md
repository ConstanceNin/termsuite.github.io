**Warning**

Currently, two of the resources have been intentionally truncated and may result in poor TermSuite performances.

The complete list of rules will be made publicly available shortly, as soon as authors's researches about multi-word term detection, syntactic and morphosyntactic term variation are published in scientific literature.

In the meantime, if you need the complete resources, please address your request to us by email directly.

Be patient ;)
